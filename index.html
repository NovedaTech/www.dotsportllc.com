            <p>dotSport LLC, a digital media/e-commerce enterprise, based in New York City, provides sports content across different product lines, to inspire and connect global audiences. <b>The common thread that ties all three product lines together is sports content across all digital devices monetized by e-commerce and advertising.</b></p>
            <p>We offer those with sport-focused lives to achieve greater heights. At dotSport, we believe we have built three genuinely beneficial, sports-focused products:</p>

            <h4>A timed, interactive video call between a professional athlete and a fan, monetized by&nbsp;e-commerce.</h4>
            <p>Our primary product enables sports fans to schedule private 20-minute, fee-based, video conversations centered on their favorite athlete’s self-selected schedule and fee. 1ON1 addresses an unmet need for fans to be inspired through personal, confidential, face-to-face video chats with admired and respected sports personalities. Starting with NHL hockey, 1ON1 expects to expand to all sports over time.</p><img

            <h4>A social network for endurance athletes, monetized by advertising and&nbsp;e-commerce (Beta).</h4>
            <p>Represented by more than 100 million participants worldwide (excluding family, fans, and other interested parties), this target market is one of the most sought after advertiser demographics due to endurance athletes being highly-mobile, tech-savvy with high disposable&nbsp;incomes.</p>

            <h4>High-value, intuitive ‘life’ websites with contextual content monetized by&nbsp;advertising.</h4>
            <p>dotSport holds trademark on the term ‘life’ for Internet-based social networks relating to sports. The company is building media sites with a portfolio of high-value ’life’ domain names with the exclusive registration rights in new top level domains because of its trademark. dotSport owns domains such as www.life.hockey and www.life.cricket, among 25 others, and intends to form content partnerships with media companies with domain expertise in these specific&nbsp;areas.</p>
            <h1 data-nav-item="Market" id="market">Be inspired. Inspire&nbsp;others.</h1>
            <p>We believe that athletes inspire people – fans and non-fans alike – as much as fans inspire athletes. From personal experience, as former premier athletes, we believe that a ‘universal higher purpose’ – the subtle underlying driver for both athlete and fan to want to engage with one another – is our&nbsp;foundation.</p>
            <p>We believe that fans follow particular sport stars not for the athlete, but rather for themselves; transference of a winning attitude drives enthusiasm and makes fans winners&nbsp;too.</p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>Preliminary 1ON1 fan intercept research done at Miami Heat (NBA) and Florida Panthers (NHL) games underscore the fact that all sports fans want to speak with their idols. We also learned that an athlete donating a portion of his/her 1ON1 fee to charity is a distinct persuasive factor that justifies a fan’s expenditure for 1ON1. Understanding that they can generate hundreds or thousands of dollars virtually every day for his/her chosen charity simply by speaking with fans during ‘down time
