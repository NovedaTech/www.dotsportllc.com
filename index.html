            <p>Our primary product enables sports fans to schedule private 20-minute, fee-based, video conversations
                centered on their favorite athlete’s self-selected schedule and fee. 1ON1 addresses an unmet need for
                fans to be inspired through personal, confidential, face-to-face video chats with admired and respected
                sports personalities. Starting with NHL hockey, 1ON1 expects to expand to all sports over time.</p><img

                parties) this target market is one of the most sought after advertiser demographics due to endurance

            <h4>High-value, intuitive ‘life’ websites with contextual content monetized by&nbsp;advertising</h4>
            <p>dotSport holds trademark on the term ‘life’ for Internet-based social networks relating to sports. The
                company is building media sites with a portfolio of high-value ’life’ domain names with the exclusive
                registration rights in new top level domains because of its trademark. dotSport owns domains such as
                www.life.hockey and www.life.cricket, among 25 others, and intends to form content partnerships with
                media companies with domain expertise in these specific&nbsp;areas.</p>
            <!-- <p>Limited funds from this offering will be used to further develop and market high-value ‘life”
                media&nbsp;websites.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Initial ‘life’ sites are anticipated to launch in Q4&nbsp;2017.</p> -->
            <h1 data-nav-item="Market" id="market">Be inspired. Inspire&nbsp;others.</h1>
            <p>We believe that athletes inspire people – fans and non-fans alike – as much as fans inspire athletes.
                From personal experience, as former premier athletes, we believe that a ‘universal higher purpose’ – the
                subtle underlying driver for both athlete and fan to want to engage with one another – is
                our&nbsp;foundation.</p>
            <p>We believe that fans follow particular sport stars not for the athlete, but rather for themselves;
                transference of a winning attitude drives enthusiasm and makes fans winners&nbsp;too.</p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>Preliminary 1ON1 fan intercept research done at Miami Heat (NBA) and Florida Panthers (NHL) games
                underscore the fact that all sports fans want to speak with their idols. We also learned that an athlete
                donating a portion of his/her 1ON1 fee to charity is a distinct persuasive factor that justifies a fan’s
                expenditure for 1ON1. Understanding that they can generate hundreds or thousands of dollars virtually
                every day for his/her chosen charity simply by speaking with fans during ‘down time’ is more than
                gratifying for pro athletes, it is a motivating&nbsp;factor.</p>
            <h4>Unique Emotional&nbsp;Experiences</h4>
            <p>We believe that the allure of a unique, emotional experience shared with a favorite professional athlete
                is a compelling stimulant to a significant segment of the global population. Capitalizing on fans’
                fondest memories we offer unique emotional&nbsp;experiences.</p>
            <h4>Lowered&nbsp;Risk</h4>
            <p>Since the addressable market for all three products is predominantly sports fans, enthusiasts and
                observers, there are cross-marketing opportunities between our product lines. This diversification of
                risk is intended to strengthen investor confidence, i.e. investors are not taking a risk on a one trick
                pony, rather on multiple product lines catering to the same market with built-in economies of scale. Our
                platforms are created by the same technology group, likewise management, marketing and operations
                support are all provided by one cohesive&nbsp;team.</p>
            <h1>Our&nbsp;Manifesto</h1>
            <p><em>We believe in 1ON1’s success because</em> present trends enable the company to amplify social media
                through every fan endorsement; effectively enabling 1ON1 to tap into ‘built-in’ viral&nbsp;potential.
            </p><img class=" lazyloaded" src="images/fans.png"
                style="height:200px; float: left; margin: 2rem 2rem 1rem 0;">
            <p>To better understand the strategy, consider today’s athlete’s use of social media options from the
                perspective of each athlete being capable of alerting his/her entire fan base to their availability on
                1ON1. Now, compound those already significant networks with the social networks of each and every fan
                who books and completes a 1ON1 with a sports idol. Every completed 1ON1 holds the potential of multiple
                tweets, Instagram, or Facebook posts of a fan’s commemorative photo, detailing their joy at the unique
                encounter of having spoken directly – exclusively – via video chat with their favorite sports&nbsp;icon.
            </p><img src="images/kona-ironman.jpg" style="height:200px; float: right; margin: 1rem 0rem 1rem 2rem;">
            <p><em>We belive in Life.Zone’s success because</em> it is the first of its kind social network for
                goal-driven athletes that provides them with the ability to post information about their training
                strategies, find and meet their peers, share advice, tips, race results, as well as find and trade
                specialized equipment. Life.Zone, a dedicated sport social media vertical, is positioned to dominate one
                of the most emotional, exciting, and fastest-growing sectors of sport – endurance&nbsp;athletes.</p>
            <p><em>We believe in Premium Life Domains’ success because</em> we are capitalizing on the growing market
                for premium domain name based websites and capturing the advertising dollars that flow to them.&nbsp;
